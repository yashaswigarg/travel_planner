"""A tiny SQLite todo board: the shared substrate every Week 5 worker uses.

A worker is handed one goal. To reach it, the worker writes its own step todos
under that goal, ticks each one off as it finishes, and marks the goal done once
the steps are complete. Days 1 to 4 each run their own little board like this;
Day 5 the same idea grows into a shared board that coordinates a whole team. The
board is a single file with one table, so it needs no server and behaves the same
on Mac and Windows. WAL mode plus a busy timeout let several agents read and write
at once without tripping over each other.
